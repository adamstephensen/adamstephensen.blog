  <div class="featurette-title">About Me</div>
  <p class="lead">If I'm not writing code or helping companies deliver software, I'm probably training, presenting or
    mentoring on new technologies, writing better code and the lessons I've learnt to help companies deliver software.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">The topics that really get me going at the moment are: Azure, Angular, Machine Learning / AI /
    Cognitive Services and choosing the right micro-services strategy.</p>
  <p class="lead">I believe communication and agility lead to success: 'fail fast', inspect, adapt, have a lot of fun.
