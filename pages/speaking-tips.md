## Two Months Before
1. Make sure you have at least 4 public test runs of your talk

## The Day Before
1. Nail your 1st 5 and last 5  
I worked for a great conference speaker - Adam Cogan.  
He taught me many things.  
Right before I did any talk, he always watned to hear the first five minutes of the talk and the last five minutes of the talk.  
These are essential.  
The first five minutes gets the user in, and excites them about the content.  
The last five minutes is when you really nail your message, and leave them inspired, and with some actions that they are excited to follow up on.  


1. 	Make sure there is someone in the audience writing down feedback for your talk. 
Choose this person carefully.. who understands what a great talk is, and cares enough about you giving good talks to be really focused on what you did well, what you didn’t do well, and what you should do next time.

2. 	Make sure there is someone in the audience taking photos of big events like this. Not 1 or 2 photos…. A hundred photos from different angles at different parts that you can then use for bios / linkedin pages blog posts etc.
Choose this person carefully. Don’t just give your phone to a random and expect good results. Using another speaker at the event who also wants great photos can work well. Suggest photographing each other – they are often excited about the suggestion. Lots of devs/ IT pros are also enthusiast photographers, finding someone like this is gold.
Digital SLR warning: I love my digital SLR. And in the hands of a pro who can take a few photos and have them come out great they are amazing. You can’t have someone with a noisy SLR taking 100 photos in your talk…. It’s really distracting. 
3. Walk the stage
While you are in the room - Do a 5 minutes test run.

## On The Day
1. Turn your phone onto airplane mode 
- Don't take calls. Don't read SMSs.  
  You don't want distractions / bad news / exciting news or anything that is going to take thought cycles. You need to get into the game.  
  If you have a partner / boss / children - explain to them that you are going to be offline until after your talk, but you'll call them as soon as you are done.  
  My wife likes to wish me well - I get her to send a text.  
  It has happened to me several times on the day of giving big talks that a phone call about one thing has introduced distractions into my head.  
  A few hours isn't going to make a difference. Turn your phone off !
  
2. Get to the room early.   
- Everyone tells you this
- If you didn't find your people  to give feedback / take photos yesterday, do it now.
