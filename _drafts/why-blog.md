# Why Blog

1. If you are doing cool things - and you are leaning on other peoples learning - there an obligation to share what you learn.
I learn how to do things by googleing for the solution , and then taking other peoples solutions, and customising them
gtherefore, i think its only right for me to share what I work out to ehlp others.

2. My job is about helping my customers do stuff with azure
If i blog it... I can get more use out of it by sharing it with other customers, and other users of azure

3. My blog is the best resume you can get.
employers dont trust resumes
my blog and my youtube account, and my github repos prove what I have done, and what I can do.
