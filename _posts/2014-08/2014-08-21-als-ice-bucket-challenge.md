<p>Yesterday Adam Cogan nominated me to take the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, the idea of which is to raise awareness and funds for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</p><p>For those that don't know much about it, ALS is a degenerative nervous disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, and causes them to die.</p><p>It's a truly terrible disease, it's cause is still a mystery and there isn't a cure.</p><p>Please take a few minutes to read about this terrible illness. http://www.alsa.org/about-als/ <br />Even better click the 'Donate' link on http://www.alsa.org/ and contribute to researching better treatmentments, and maybe one-day a cure for this terrible disease.</p><p>I'm going to nominate a few people to take the challenge<br />Scott Allen <a href="https://twitter.com/OdeToCode" target="_blank">@OdeToCode</a><br />Ivan Storck <a href="https://twitter.com/ivanoats" target="_blank">@ivanoats</a><br />David Burela <a href="https://twitter.com/davidburela">@DavidBurela</a></p><p>Here is Adam C issuing the challenge http://bit.ly/als-adamcogan</p><p>Here is my attempt </p>
