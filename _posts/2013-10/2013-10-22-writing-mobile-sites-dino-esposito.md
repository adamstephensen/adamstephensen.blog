I caught up with Dino Esposito, Technical Evangelist at JetBrains, to discuss the lessons learnt building mobile apps and sites. 

Many of today’s users are on the web via mobile devices, yet too many web sites are neither optimized nor adapted to render on multiple devices. Too many developers think a little CSS magic will do the trick. 

Responsive Web Design (RWD) delivers multi-device views without extra costs, but what if you have workflows to implement or different use-cases? 

This video session with Dino looks at a few real examples where RWD is not enough and server-side detection is necessary.
