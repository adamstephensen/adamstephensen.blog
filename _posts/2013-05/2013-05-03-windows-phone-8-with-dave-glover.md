I was joined by Windows Phone Developer Evangelist Dave Glover from Microsoft to talk about Windows Phone 8 development.

We chat about how far Windows Phone has come since the release of Windows Phone 7, how it is tracking against its competitors, where it fits into the market, and the opportunities for developers in the Windows Phone Marketplace.

In this video, we discuss:

 - The range of hardware running the platform
 - Key apps for the platform
 - How it’s easier to build apps for Windows Phone than any other platform
 - What’s new in Windows Phone 8
 - How to get your app noticed on the Marketplace
