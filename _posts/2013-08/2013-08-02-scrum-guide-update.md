<p>The originators of Scrum, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland have released an updated version of the Scrum Guide. <p>Go here to get the latest version <p><a href="http://www.scrumguides.org/">http://www.scrumguides.org/</a> <p>Go here for their summary of the changes <p><a href="http://www.scrumguides.org/s/Scrum-Guide-2013-Changes.pdf">http://www.scrumguides.org/s/Scrum-Guide-2013-Changes.pdf</a> <p>Go here for a 17 min video of them discussing the changes. <p><a href="http://scrumguides.squarespace.com/2013-scrum-guide-changes-video/">http://scrumguides.squarespace.com/2013-scrum-guide-changes-video/</a> <p>Here are my key points taken from the video, and the summary page, and a few comments about them. <h5>Interesting points on the uptake of Scrum </h5> <p>- two years ago the US Congress passed a law that all Department of Defence IT Projects must be agile <p><a href="http://scrum.jeffsutherland.com/2012/04/dod-goes-agile.html">http://scrum.jeffsutherland.com/2012/04/dod-goes-agile.html</a> <p>- this year.. the US embedded the Agile Manifesto in its government regulations <p><a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">http://agilemanifesto.org/</a> <p>- The US post office has mandated Scrum everywhere in IT <p>- The Gartner group says 'abandon waterfall.. get agile' <p><a href="http://blog.alinean.com/2012/11/are-you-ready-for-business-controlled.html?goback=%2Egde_2753627_member_185856692">http://blog.alinean.com/2012/11/are-you-ready-for-business-controlled.html?goback=%2Egde_2753627_member_185856692</a> <p><a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2207915">http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2207915</a> <p>-Jim Johnson at the Stannis group repots: In a survey of 50-100,000 projects where success is defined as on time, on budget with happy customers (in itself a waterfall benchmark) -  <p>The success rate in waterfall projects is 14% <p>The success in agile is 42% (Jeff believes this is not great.. but a conservative figure) <p>- The Forster report: next year there will be 3 trillion dollars spent on software <p>Ken: "our way of trying to narrow the gap between software that is needed and the available provisioning capacity is  <p>- higher productivity <p>- higher value <p>- higher quality" <h3>The 6 key changes to the 2013 Scrum Guide</h3> <h4>1. Re-emphasising Transparency </h4> <p>A new section on Artefact Transparency has been added. <p>The key point made was that Ken and Jeff wanted to make it clear that if things are not visible to everyone, bad decisions can be made.  <p>All of the Scrum artefacts should be transparent, and easily understood by everyone who is looking at them in order to maximise value and minimise risk. <h4>2. Sprint Planning – One Section and a Sprint Goal</h4> <p>The sprint planning meeting is no longer divided into two sections. <p>The concept of the Sprint Goal was in the 2011 scrum guide, but it wasn’t clear enough and not enforced enough. <p>In the current edition, you must come out of sprint planning with a sprint goal.  <p>The sprint goal should provide focus to the team. <h4>3. Product Backlog – being ‘Ready’</h4> <p>The term 'Grooming' has been replaced with the term 'Refinement' (due to cultural sensitivity). <p>The 'Ready' state is being emphasised (as has previously been done with the 'Done' state) <p>Items that are 'Ready' are defined clearly enough and with enough detail to be able to be added to a sprint. <p>BEFORE the sprint planning meeting, PBIs that may be added to the sprint should be refined until they are 'Ready'. This will accelerate the sprint planning meeting. <p>I think this is awesome. As a consultant, one of the issues I commonly find on Scrum teams is that the Sprint Planning meeting drags.  <p>I always push back on Product Owners that if they want punchy Sprint Planning meetings, they should prioritise having a well groomed backlog with all of the BPIs likely to be included in the next sprint ready for estimation and inclusion. <h4>4. Time Boxed Events</h4> <p>When you set the length of the sprint it does not change, but the meeting times specified are maximums. <p>(I don't see this as a big change). <h4>5. Daily Scrum – a Planning Event</h4> <p>The new guide reinforces the importance of the Daily Scrum as a PLANNING event, not just a status event. <p>It provides a great focus on each team member contributing and delivering value. <p>Ken: 'It is about creating situations for the team to work together' <p>Every day the team should organise how they will work together to accomplish the sprint goal <p>The input to the meeting is how well the team is going. <p>The output from the meeting is a new or revised plan that optimises the teams efforts. <p>The three questions have been reformulated to emphasise the team over the individual. <p>a. What did I do yesterday that helped the Dev Team meet the Sprint Goal? <p>b. What will I do today to help the Dev Team meet the Sprint Goal? <p>c. Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Dev Team from meeting the Sprint Goal ? <p>There is a greater focus on the sprint goal, rather than just on the status of what 'I' did. <p>Only tasks that contribute to the sprint goal are relevant. <p>A great example is given  <p>- if a team member says 'I spent the day writing this great report' but the report does not contribute to the sprint goal  <p>a. it should not have been included in the daily scrum (as it does not contribute to the sprint goal) <p>b. if they team member was busy, but did not contribute to the sprint goal, as far as the daily scrum is concerned... they did nothing <p>c. it could actually be considered an impediment as the team member is not focused on the sprint goal <h4>6. Delivering Value</h4> <p>The concept of value is reinforced. <p>The product backlog should be prioritised by value. <p>At the end of the sprint review, one of the primary outputs should be a refined sprint backlog that will optimise the VALUE of the work the team is doing. <p>During the sprint review - the question is asked 'based on what was done in the sprint what are the next things that could be done to optimise value ?' <p>The point is to maximise the value that the team delivers. <p>I say: Bravo ! <p>Great quote: "We've got goals, we've got value, we've got transparency, we've got more teamwork ..it's all good." <p>Other references: <p><a href="http://scrum.jeffsutherland.com/2012/12/tipping-point-get-agile-or-get.html">http://scrum.jeffsutherland.com/2012/12/tipping-point-get-agile-or-get.html</a></p>
