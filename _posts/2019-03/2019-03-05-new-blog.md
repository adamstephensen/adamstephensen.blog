# A New Blog - Jekyll + GitHub + Azure DevOps

I've left WordPress. Finally.

WordPress isn't bad. In fact for most people I think WordPress or Medium are probably the right choice. - but for about 18 months I've wanted to move to a solution where I hosted my content on GitHub and then published it from there.

Why ? (the original reasons from 18 months ago) 
- I love writing in MarkDown. I want to write more blogs and in order to write more - I need to enjoy doing it. 
- I wanted the content without formatting. This allows me to do more with it.
- I wanted to be able to collaborate with my blog content. If you want to make a change or an addition - feel free to make a pull request.

Why? (the driving reasons that made me finally do it)
- I like having some 'real' projects to maintain
- I wanted to be able to easily edit content offline
- I wanted a project to use for Azure demos around topics like DevOps, containers and Azure FrontDoor

Why not ? (Reasons this approach is silly for most people)
- You are maintaing code and investing time in something that someone else will do for (Almost) free
## Other Solutions that I considered 

### Hosted Services

#### [Medium] [https://medium.com/](https://medium.com/)
If you just want to elegantly write content Medium is clean and awesome.
This is a great option. 

#### Hosted WordPress https://wordpress.com 
WordPress.com is where I hosted my blog for the last 7 years.
I set it up, and it just ran. I paid about $5 to remove the adds and have a custom domain.
It supports a huge ecosystem of plugins and functionality.
For most developers this is probably my recommended solution.
Official hosted wordpress - https://wordpress.com 
Alternative hosted WordPress (My friend Jason has used this for years and loves it) https://www.bluehost.com/ 


#### Hosted Ghost https://ghost.org
Ghost is where all the cool kids were at.
If hosted Ghost were not 10x more expensive that WordPress, everyone would use this.
This article from Troy Hunt is a great summary of why it's the best choice if you are happy to pay the money.

### Self Hosted Services

#### Self Hostd Wordpress
Don't do it. 
If you are going to do it yourself - Host Ghost

#### Self Hosted Ghost https://blog.ghost.org/2-0/
- Thiago Passord: Deploying Ghost on Azure https://github.com/thiagospassos/tryghost
  Note. [Ghost 2.0](https://blog.ghost.org/2-0/) is out and Thiago hasn't upgraded his project to v2.0
- There are options for deploying Ghost in a container in Azure (or for awesome overkill in a K8s cluster)
   Watch this space for that one.


## Resources and Thanks
I got the idea for this method from the [old version of the Azure Docs](https://github.com/Azure/azure.github.io) which used Jekyll. I created this project from scratch because the old docs used very outdated versions of dependencies like Jekyll and Bootstrap but I have taken the page templates and a few scripts from their repo... so big thanks to the team who put it together !!!
