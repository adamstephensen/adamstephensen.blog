Bots are the new UI frontier. Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa started the trend, but no-UI is the future of UI. Users are going to expect to be able to have conversations with companies and organisations in the client that they have on hand. Don't believe me? Gartner predicts that by 2020 30% of HTTP requests will be via bots.

In this session, we will explore how the Microsoft Bot Framework makes it easy to build and connect intelligent bots to interact with users and services. Take your existing applications, your FAQ or a great new idea you have and build a bot that will run from your website or from Cortana, Skype, a phone call, text message, Teams, Slack, Facebook Messenger, Skype for Business and more.

If you missed the mobile revolution - why not lead in the bot wars?
